For the past couple of months, <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/" target="_blank">React Native</a> has become very popular in the mobile developers community. It started with the release of <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/" target="_blank">React</a>, a library to build web user interfaces. Since React can wrap any imperative view system and does not necessarily rely on the DOM, it was just a matter of time before Facebook released React Native. This framework allows developers to build truly native UIs for Android and iOS using JavaScript and JSX.

It provides <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/native-components-ios.html" target="_blank">multiple UI components</a> like scroll view, list view, button, date picker, map view or image, for example, along with powerful APIs to build the front-end of your application. For the back-end, <a href="https://market.yaas.io/" target="_blank">YaaS microservices</a> can be leveraged to add features like authentication, user accounts, persistence, or e-commerce functionalities (cart, checkout, order, etc.).

This article will explore how you can get started with React Native and YaaS to build your next mobile application. To see a working project using React Native and YaaS, take a look at <a href="https://github.com/loic-d/local-groceries" target="_blank">this GitHub repository</a>. The code samples presented below are part of this project.

<h2>Getting started with SAP Hybris as a Service (YaaS)</h2>

YaaS is a microservice development platform with pre-built tools and services that let you rapidly develop solutions and deploy them to the cloud. To use YaaS, you need to <a href="https://yaas.io" target="_blank">create an account</a> and follow the <a href="https://devportal.yaas.io/tools/builder/" target"_blank">step-by-step guide</a> to get familiar with <a href="https://builder.yaas.io" target"_blank">Builder</a>, the YaaS back-office management tool. This step-by-step guide is part of the <a href="https://devportal.yaas.io/" target"_blank">Dev portal</a>, a place where you can find any YaaS related documentation. This article will focus on consuming microservices in the context of a React Native application.

To understand how each microservice works, look at its API contract. It gives you the available endpoints that your client can consume. With the <a href="https://api.yaas.io/hybris/product/v2/" target="_blank" title="Product API Console">Product</a> service for example, the <a href="https://api.yaas.io/hybris/product/v2/" target="_blank">API contract</a> will show you that a <span class="code-quote">GET</span> request can be sent to <span class="code-quote">https://api.yaas.io/hybris/product/v2/YOUR_TENANT/products</span> to fetch the list of all products for your tenant. A JSON payload will be returned and your application can then display the products to the user. You need to add a few products first, either from <a href="https://builder.yaas.io" target="_blank" title="Builder">Builder</a> or by sending API calls directly to the service.

Most of the YaaS services are <a href="https://devportal.yaas.io/overview/security/10_authorization.html" target="_blank">protected</a>. This means you need to add an <span class="code-quote">Authorization</span> header containing your access token with every request. In a real client application, you will create an HTTP interceptor that automaticaly appends the generated <span class="code-quote">Authorization</span> header. For example, your React Native app can generate a YaaS access token for a user using the <span class="code-quote">/login</span> endpoint of the <span class="code-quote">customer</span> service, then persist it in <span class="code-quote">AsynStorage</span> and add it to the request header of each API call.

<p class="file-title">/src/lib/api.js</p>
[raw]
<div hljs language="javascript">
// Partial code
// We assume that this code is wrapped in an async function called on every API call
// 'req' is the request object.

const apiToken = await AsyncStorage.getItem('api/token');
if (apiToken) {
  debug('', `Found api/token in AsyncStorage ${apiToken}`);
  req.headers.Authorization = `Bearer ${apiToken}`;
}
</div>
[/raw]

Once the interceptor added the required Authorization header, the request is sent to the microservice. You can use the <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/network.html" target="_blank">Fetch API</a> to load resources from a remote URL. This API exposes a <span class="code-quote">fetch()</span> method returning a <span class="code-quote">Promise</span> that resolves to the <span class="code-quote">Response</span> of your request.

<h2>Setup your React Native application</h2>
Now that you know how to send API calls to a YaaS microservice, create a configuration file exposing the services endpoints, along with your tenant, client ID and the API root.

<p class="file-title">/src/constants/api.js</p>
[raw]
<div hljs hljs-no-escape language="javascript">
const TENANT = 'YOUR_TENANT';
const CLIENT_ID = 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID';

export default {
  // YaaS API Proxy URL
  hostname: 'https://api.yaas.io',

  // YaaS Tenant
  tenant: TENANT,

  // YaaS Client ID
  clientID: CLIENT_ID,

  // YaaS Endpoints
  endpoints: new Map([
    ['login', `/hybris/customer/v1/${TENANT}/login`],
    ['user', `/hybris/customer/v1/${TENANT}/me`],
    ['anonymousLogin', `/hybris/customerlogin/v1/auth/anonymous/login?client_id=${CLIENT_ID}&hybris-tenant=${TENANT}`],
    ['products', `/hybris/productdetails/v2/${TENANT}/productdetails`],
    ['cart', `/hybris/cart/v1/${TENANT}/carts`],
    ['checkout', `/hybris/checkout/v1/${TENANT}/checkouts/order`]
  ])
};
</div>
[/raw]

Note that all API calls are sent to the same hostname. This hostname is actually a proxy checking if you have the right permissions to access a resource. If you do, your request will be forwared to the real service deployed on any hosting or cloud platform. With this configuration, you will be able to call the following services:
<ul>
  <li><span class="code-quote">customer</span> to login users and get the logged-in user information</li>
  <li><span class="code-quote">customerlogin</span> to get an anonymous user token before the user is anthenticated</li>
  <li><span class="code-quote">productdetails</span> to get product details like name, descriptions, prices, images, etc.</li>
  <li><span class="code-quote">cart</span> to create a cart for the user and add items to this cart</li>
  <li><span class="code-quote">checkout</span> to place an order</li>
</ul>

Each endpoint will be added to an <span class="code-quote">AppAPI</span> service with methods to do HTTP operations: <span class="code-quote">get</span>, <span class="code-quote">patch</span>, <span class="code-quote">put</span>, <span class="code-quote">post</span> and <span class="code-quote">delete</span>. This service comes with the <a href="https://github.com/mcnamee/react-native-starter-app" target="_blank" title="React Native Starter App">React Native Starter App</a> used for this project, and allows API calls to be sent in a more verbose way. To get a list of products, you can simply write the following code:

[raw]
<div hljs hljs-no-escape language="javascript">
// Get all products
AppAPI.products.get()
     .then((products) => {
         const products = products;
     });
</div>
[/raw]

Note that the service is converting the <span class="code-quote">Response</span> to a plain JS object. You can also create your own API services that don't require the use of <a href="https://github.com/mcnamee/react-native-starter-app" target="_blank" title="React Native Starter App">React Native Starter App</a>.

<h2>Build your first screen</h2>

It's time to build your first screen! It will be a JavaScript class extending a React <span class="code-quote">Component</span>. This class will expose a <span class="code-quote">render()</span> method where you define the layout of the screen using JSX markup. The advantage of React is that you don't need another templating language to add logic to a view: you can rely on JavaScript control structures like <span class="code-quote">forEach</span> because JSX is transpilled to JavaScript.

Let's say you want ot build a page displaying a list of products, first you would need to fetch the data from the YaaS <span class="code-quote">productdetails</span> or <span class="code-quote">product</span> service. This can be done from the component in <span class="code-quote">componentDidMount()</span> or from a parent component and pass the list of products to your component as a prop. If you are not familiar with React Component lifecycle, take a look at the <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/react-component.html" title="React Component Lifecycle" target="_blank">official documention</a>.

[raw]
<div hljs hljs-no-escape>
componentDidMount() {
    // Fetch the list of products
    this.fetchProducts();
}
</div>
[/raw]

[raw]
<div hljs hljs-no-escape>
/**
 * Fetch all products and update the state of the component
 */
fetchProducts = () => {
    this.props.getProducts()
        .then(() => {
            this.setState({
                products: this.props.products
            });
        })
}
</div>
[/raw]

The component receives the action <span class="code-quote">getProducts()</span> as a prop. <a href="https://github.com/reactjs/redux" target="_blank" title="Redux">Redux</a>, a predictable state container for JS apps, allows this by mapping actions to component's props. We also call <span class="code-quote">setState()</span> with the fetched products to update the component's state.

Once the state is updated, you need to iterate over each product and create single product components. The view will display all of these products components. Each component has to define a <span class="code-quote">key</span> attribute with a unique value on its root element. This is mandatory when you work with lists: it allows React to identify which items have been changed, added, or removed.

Your function to render the list of products could look like this:

<p class="file-title">/src/containers/products/ProductsView.js</p>
[raw]
<div hljs hljs-no-escape>
// Partial code. Make sure you import the required components and libraries.

/**
 * Render the list of product cards
 * @param products
 * @returns {Array}
 */
renderProducts = (products) =&gt; {
    // Function called onPress add to cart button
    // Delegates to component method
    const addItemToCart = (product) => {
        this.addItemToCart(product);
    };

    // This array will hold each product component
    const productsJsx = [];
    // Iterator used for the 'key' attribute
    let iterator = 1;

    // Iterate over each product
    products.forEach((product) => {
        productsJsx.push(
            &lt;View key={`product-${iterator}`} style={[AppStyles.row]}&gt;
                &lt;Card
                    image={{ uri: product.image }}&gt;
                    &lt;View style={[AppStyles.paddingLeftSml, AppStyles.paddingBottomSml]}&gt;
                        &lt;Text h3>{product.name} {product.unit.length > 0 ? `- ${product.unit}` : ''}&gt;/Text&gt;
                        &lt;Text style={[styles.price]}&gt;
                            ${product.displayPrice} ({product.currency})
                        &lt;/Text&gt;
                        &lt;Text style={[styles.description]}&gt;
                            {product.description}
                        &lt;/Text&gt;
                        &lt;Button
                            small
                            outlined
                            title={'Add to cart'}
                            onPress={() => addItemToCart(product)} /&gt;
                    &lt;/View&gt;
                &lt;/Card&gt;
            &lt;/View&gt;
        );
        iterator += 1;
    });

    // Return an Array containing all the product components
    return productsJsx;
}
</div>
[/raw]

With the styling added in this project, each product component will look like this:

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-5">
    <img src="http://loic-delaubier.com/api/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/card_component.png" class="content-img no-border" alt="A product component" />
  </div>
</div>

We are able to <span class="code-quote">push</span> JSX components to the <span class="code-quote">productsJsx</span> Array and return it. If you have a long list of products, it is a good idea to only render a few products at a time for performance matters.

You can now call <span class="code-quote">renderProducts()</span> in the Component's <span class="code-quote">render</span> method.

[raw]
<div hljs hljs-no-escape>
render = () => (
  &lt;View style={styles.tabContainer}&gt;
      &lt;ScrollView
          automaticallyAdjustContentInsets={false}
          style={[AppStyles.container]}
      &gt;
      { this.renderProducts(this.state.products) }
      &lt;/ScrollView&gt;
  &lt;/View&gt;
)
</div>
[/raw]

As seen, we are mixing JSX and JavaScript. This is possible because <span class="code-quote">renderProducts()</span> is returning an Array of JSX components.

<h2>Add E-commerce features in minutes</h2>

Want users to add items to a cart and checkout? YaaS provides the <a href="https://api.yaas.io/hybris/cart/v1/" target="_blank" title="Cart API Console">Cart</a> and <a href="https://api.yaas.io/hybris/checkout/v1/" target="_blank" title="Checkout API Console">Checkout</a> microservices. To create a cart for a user, send a <span class="code-quote">POST</span> request to <span class="code-quote">https://api.yaas.io/hybris/cart/v1/YOUR_TENANT/carts</span> providing the <span class="code-quote">currency</span> and <span class="code-quote">customerId</span> in the request body:

[raw]
<div hljs hljs-no-escape>
/**
 * Creates a new Cart
 * @returns {Function}
 */
export function createCart(userId) {
    return () => {
        // Create a Canadian cart by default
        return AppAPI.cart.post(null, {
            currency: 'CAD',
            customerId: userId
        });
    };
}
</div>
[/raw]

In order to add items to a cart, the following function will do the job (we are using Redux here). This allows us to dispatch an event containing the updated cart to the store. We want to make sure the application always has the most updated state. A message is also displayed to the user using the <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/alert.html" target="_blank" title="Alert API">Alert</a> API.

<p class="file-title">/src/redux/cart/actions.js</p>
[raw]
<div hljs hljs-no-escape>
// Partial code. Make sure you import the required components and libraries.

/**
 * Add an item to a cart
 * @param cartId
 * @param itemYrn
 * @param itemPrice
 * @returns {Function}
 */
export function addItemToCart(cartId, itemYrn, itemPrice) {
    return (dispatch) => {

        // Build the cart item body
        // TODO: Allow user to add more than one item at the time
        const cartItemBody = {
            quantity: 1,
            price: itemPrice,
            itemYrn: itemYrn
        };

        return AppAPI.cart.post(`${cartId}/items`, cartItemBody)
            .then(() => {

                Alert.alert('Item added to Cart', 'Go to Checkout to place your order.');

                // Get the updated cart and dispatch
                AppAPI.cart.get(cartId)
                    .then((cart) => {
                        dispatch({
                            type: 'CART_UPDATED',
                            data: cart
                        });
                    })
                    .catch((error) => {
                        console.log(`getCart ${cartId} failed`, error);
                    });

            })
            .catch((error) => {
                console.log(`addItemToCart ${cartId} ${itemYrn} failed`, error);
            });
    };
}
[/raw]
</div>

The next step is to place an order. The <span class="code-quote">checkout</span> service provides an endpoint where you can send a <span class="code-quote">POST</span> request to <span class="code-quote">https://api.yaas.io/hybris/checkout/v1/YOUR_TENANT/checkouts/order</span>. In the request body, provide all the information required by the service: user's details including the billing and shipping addresses, payment method, cart Id, total price and currency.

[raw]
<div hljs hljs-no-escape language="javascript">
// Valid request body

// 'cart' is the user's cart object
// 'user' is the current user's object
// 'addresses' is an object containing all the current user's addresses (returned by the customer service)

const orderBody = {
    paymentMethods: [{
        provider: 'stripe',
        paymentMethodYrn: 'urn:yaas:hybris:payments:payment-method:checkoutat;invoice',
        method: 'invoice'
    }],
    cartId: cart.id,
    currency: 'CAD',
    addresses: [
        {
            ...addresses[0],
            type: 'BILLING'
        },
        {
            ...addresses[0],
            type: 'SHIPPING'
        }
    ],
    customer: {
        id: user.id,
        firstName: user.firstName,
        lastName: user.lastName,
        email: user.contactEmail
    },
    totalPrice: cart.totalPrice.amount,
};
</div>
[/raw]

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
Hybris as a Service (YaaS) allows you to rapidly build and deploy solutions using microservices. These services can be used with any kind of client: web pages, IoT devices, native apps, etc. In the context of a React Native application, it is simply done by sending API calls using the <span class="code-quote">Fetch</span> API.

Remember that most of the YaaS services are protected and have different endpoints you can consume. To understand them, read the API contract available at the root of the service. To learn more about the <span class="code-quote">cart</span> service for example, go to <span class="code-quote">https://api.yaas.io/hybris/cart/v1/</span>.

Hopefuly, this has provided you with the proper basis on how to use YaaS in React Native applications. If you want to see a working project using React Native, Redux and YaaS, checkout <a href="https://github.com/loic-d/local-groceries" target="_blank">this GitHub repository</a>.
